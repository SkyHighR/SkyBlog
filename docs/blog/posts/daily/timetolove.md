    There's something that I can't quite explain  
    I'm so in love with you  
    You'll never take that away  
    And if I've said it a hundred times before  
    Expect a thousand more  
    You'll never take that away  

    Well expect me to be  
    Calling you to see  
    If you're OK when I'm not around  
    Asking "if you love me"  
    I love the way you make it sound  
    Calling you to see  
    Do I try too hard to make you smile?  
    To make us smile  

    I will keep calling you to see  
    If you're sleeping, are you dreaming  
    If you're dreaming, are you dreaming of me  
    I can't believe you actually picked me  

    I thought that the world had lost it's sway  
    It's so hard sometimes  
    Then I fell in love with you  
    Then came you  
    And you took that away  
    It's not so difficult  
    The world is not so difficult  
    You take away the old  
    Show me the new  
    And I feel like I can fly when I stand next to you  
    So while I'm on this phone  
    A hundred miles from home  
    I'll take the words you gave me and send them back to you  

    I only want to see  
    If you're OK when I'm not around  
    Asking "if you love me"  
    I love the way you make it sound  
    Calling you to see  
    Do I try too hard to make you smile?  
    To make us smile
